# Hello-World
My test &amp; small jobs
Some of these pprograms are written in Python or C or C#.
## 01: Using simplex method to solve linear optimal problem(helloword.cpp& helloword. exe):
    this is the input demo or so called instructions with program results :
    Read me
### Before using this program, you should make sure that the problem is 'maximum' form and all the constrains are equation form.One line one contraint.And the last line of the coefficient matrix is belong to objective function. Please input the number of constraints : m =  
3  
m = 3  
Please input the number of variables : n =  
5   
n = 5   
Please input the matrix of coefficients
